# Integration Guide

This guide is for teams building an IDE or editor on top of this engine. It covers setting up code execution and the debugger.

---

## Installation

```sh
npm install debugger-sh
```

The package ships a WebAssembly binary and TypeScript bindings. Initialize it once before use:

```ts
import { Engine } from 'debugger-sh';

const engine = await Engine.create('c'); // or 'python'
```

---

## Running Code

Set the virtual filesystem, then call `run()`. The program sees `/main.c` as its source file.

```ts
engine.fs = {
  'main.c': `#include <iostream>\nint main() { std::cout << "hello\\n"; }`
};

await engine.run();
```

**stdout / stderr** use a small event-style API: subscribe with `on('data', …)` and unsubscribe with `off` using the same listener function. Each chunk is a `Uint8Array` of UTF-8 bytes.

```ts
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
const onOut = (chunk: Uint8Array) => {
  console.log(decoder.decode(chunk));
};
engine.stdout.on('data', onOut);
engine.stderr.on('data', onOut);

// When tearing down (optional if the engine is discarded):
engine.stdout.off('data', onOut);
engine.stderr.off('data', onOut);
```

**stdin** exposes `write(value: string | Uint8Array)` (UTF-8 for strings):

```ts
await engine.stdin.write('hello\n');
await engine.stdin.write(new TextEncoder().encode('hello\n'));
```

To stop a running program:

```ts
engine.stop();
```

---

## Debugger (DAP)

The debugger exposes a [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) interface. Requests are sent synchronously and return a response. DAP messages (events, and optionally routed responses) are emitted asynchronously through the `event` listener.

```ts
const dbg = engine.debugger;

dbg.on('event', (msg) => {
  // receives both events (type: 'event') and — if you choose to route them here — responses
  console.log(msg);
});
```

### Initialization Sequence

Order matches the DAP test harness (`tools/dap/run.ts` + `tools/dap/tests/lang/adapters/c-cpp/engine.ts`):

1. **Client** registers `dbg.on('event', …)` for `initialized`, `stopped`, and `terminated`.
2. **Client** starts **`engine.run()`** without awaiting it yet — the worker compiles (C) or boots the debug bridge (Python) and then **blocks** until step **9**.
3. **Client →** `initialize` request (can be sent while `run()` is in flight).
4. **Adapter →** `initialize` response (body includes **Capabilities**, e.g. `supportsConfigurationDoneRequest`).
5. **Adapter** builds the internal debugger when the worker sends its `debug` / `python_debug` message (instrumented binary or Python SAB ready).
6. **Adapter →** `initialized` event — emitted only after steps **4** and **5** (client has initialized **and** a debugger backend is attached).
7. **Client →** `setBreakpoints` (zero or more; one request per source file).
8. **Client →** `setExceptionBreakpoints` when you have filters to set (empty `filters: []` is fine).
9. **Client →** `configurationDone`
10. **Adapter →** `configurationDone` response — the debuggee then leaves its initial wait and **starts running**.

Until step **9** succeeds, `configurationDone` returns an error (`debugger not ready`). The worker is blocked on the main thread, so you must complete the handshake while `run()` is still pending — typically by running `run()` and the handshake **in parallel**.

Do **not** rely on the `initialized` event alone: also retry steps **7–9** until `configurationDone` returns `success: true` (the IDE and test harness both poll). The event is a useful early signal, but the worker may attach slightly before or after the event is delivered to your listener.

```ts
let seq = 1;
let handshakeDone = false;

const completeHandshake = () => {
  if (handshakeDone) return true;

  dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: seq++,
    command: 'setBreakpoints',
    arguments: {
      source: { path: '/main.c' },
      breakpoints: [{ line: 5 }]
    }
  });

  dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: seq++,
    command: 'setExceptionBreakpoints',
    arguments: { filters: [] }
  });

  const res = dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: seq++,
    command: 'configurationDone',
    arguments: {}
  }) as { success?: boolean };

  if (res?.success) handshakeDone = true;
  return handshakeDone;
};

dbg.on('event', (msg: { type: string; event?: string }) => {
  if (msg.type === 'event' && msg.event === 'initialized') completeHandshake();
});

const runPromise = engine.run();

dbg.send({ type: 'request', seq: seq++, command: 'initialize', arguments: {} });

while (!handshakeDone) {
  if (completeHandshake()) break;
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 50));
}

await runPromise;
```

### Handling a pause (`stopped`)

Whenever the debuggee stops—on a **line breakpoint** or after a **step** request—the adapter emits a `stopped` event. Use `body.reason` to tell them apart:

- **`breakpoint`** — the worker paused in normal mode because execution reached a line where you set a breakpoint.
- **`step`** — the worker paused while a step mode was active (`next`, `stepIn`, or `stepOut`). The next section describes how those modes work internally.

`threadId` is always `1` (single-threaded engine).

```ts
if (msg.type === 'event' && msg.event === 'stopped') {
  const res = dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: n++,
    command: 'stackTrace',
    arguments: { threadId: 1 }
  }) as { body?: { stackFrames?: { id: number }[] } };
  const top = res.body?.stackFrames?.[0];
  if (!top) return;

  const scopesRes = dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: n++,
    command: 'scopes',
    arguments: { frameId: top.id }
  }) as { body?: { scopes?: { variablesReference: number }[] } };
  const localsRef = scopesRes.body?.scopes?.find((s) => s.name === 'Locals')?.variablesReference;
  if (localsRef == null) return;

  dbg.send({
    type: 'request',
    seq: n++,
    command: 'variables',
    arguments: { variablesReference: localsRef }
  });

  dbg.send({ type: 'request', seq: n++, command: 'continue', arguments: { threadId: 1 } });
}
```

### Stepping

Stepping does **not** use a separate single-stepping primitive in the CPU. The program is compiled with **instrumentation**: at each debuggable machine location there is a shared hook that can stop execution. The main thread and the worker coordinate through a small prefix on the **same `SharedArrayBuffer`** that also holds per-location breakpoint enable flags (see `DebugInfo` / `BP_PREFIX_BYTES` in the Rust sources).

That prefix (exposed to JS as the first elements of `get_bp_state()`, an `Int32Array` view) is laid out conceptually as:

| Index | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | Stack pointer handshake: non-zero while paused, cleared to resume                                                                                                                                   |
| `1`   | **Execution mode** — what to do at the next instrumented sites the worker reaches                                                                                                                   |
| `2`   | **`last_sp`** — stack pointer saved when the _previous_ pause ended; used to implement step-over and step-out                                                                                       |
| `3`   | **`last_stop_mode`** — mode that was active when the worker _decided_ to pause this time (written before mode is reset); the adapter uses this to set DAP `stopped.reason` (`breakpoint` vs `step`) |

**Modes** (`1`, written by the main-thread `Debugger` before waking the worker):

| Value | Name      | Meaning at instrumentation sites                                                                         |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | Normal    | Stop only at locations where you have set a breakpoint (`setBreakpoints`).                               |
| `1`   | Step into | Stop at the next instrumented site that runs (enters callees if the next site is there).                 |
| `2`   | Step over | Stop only when the stack pointer is **≥ `last_sp`** (same or outer frame versus where you stepped from). |
| `3`   | Step out  | Stop only when the stack pointer is **> `last_sp`** (strictly outer frame).                              |

DAP wiring:

- **`continue`** — set mode to normal and wake the worker; variable handles from the previous pause are cleared.
- **`next`** — set mode to step-over, then wake.
- **`stepIn`** — set mode to step-into, then wake.
- **`stepOut`** — set mode to step-out, then wake.

After each successful stop, the worker resets mode to **normal** and updates **`last_sp`** to the current stack pointer so the next `next` / `stepOut` is relative to the line you actually landed on. The worker posts a minimal `breakpoint` message to the main thread; **pause classification for DAP** (`stopped.reason`) comes from reading **`last_stop_mode`** on that shared buffer, not from fields on the worker message.

**Caveats:**

- Stepping is **line-oriented** over instrumented WASM PCs, not a hardware single-step.
- Very dense control flow (e.g. multiple statements on one line) follows whatever the instrumentation map does—validate behavior with `npm run tools:dap` if you rely on edge cases.

### Presentation filtering (Python)

When building a student-facing IDE, you usually want to hide debugger/runtime noise from `stackTrace` and `scopes` responses. The engine applies **Python-only** filters; C/C++ stacks come from DWARF and are not filtered the same way.

#### Stack frames — `debugger.filterInternals`

Set **before** `run()`:

```ts
engine.debugger.filterInternals = true; // recommended for student UIs
```

| `filterInternals` | `stackTrace` behaviour                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `false` (default) | All frames are returned. Internal frames use `presentationHint: "subtle"`; user code uses `"normal"`. Clients can hide or dim subtle frames themselves. |
| `true`            | Frames where `user` is `false` are omitted from the response.                                                                                           |

A frame is **`user: true`** when its source path is `/main.py` (the student's virtual file). Everything else — the Bdb bridge (`/_bridge.py`), stdlib, etc. — is internal.

Internal frames always carry `presentationHint: "subtle"` even when `filterInternals` is `false`, so you can implement a “show internals” toggle without re-querying the worker:

```ts
const frames = res.body?.stackFrames ?? [];
const studentFrames = frames.filter((f) => f.presentationHint !== 'subtle');
```

#### Frame names

Python reports module-level code as `<module>`. The bridge renames frames for readability:

| Location                         | Python `co_name`   | Displayed name |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `/main.py` module scope          | `<module>`         | `__main__`     |
| `/main.py` function              | e.g. `main`, `add` | unchanged      |
| Other files (e.g. `/_bridge.py`) | `<module>`         | `<module>`     |

So a typical `def main():` + `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` stack shows **`main`** (the function) and **`__main__`** (the module-level caller) — not two frames both named `main`.

#### Locals — dunder names

Python `scopes` / `variables` responses **always** omit names matching `__*__` (e.g. `__builtins__`, `__file__`, `__name__`). There is no client toggle yet; those names are stripped in the adapter before DAP responses are built.

#### Locals — `list`, `dict`, and `tuple`

Container locals are expandable in the variables tree (like C++ structs):

- **Scalars** — `variablesReference: 0`, value is a truncated `repr` (120 characters max).
- **`list` / `tuple`** — summary `list[N]` / `tuple[N]` with indexed children `[0]`, `[1]`, …
- **`dict`** — summary `dict[N]` with named children (string keys as-is, other keys via `repr`).

The worker pre-serializes up to **3 levels** of nesting, **50 children** per container, then the client can request deeper levels via `variables` + `variablesReference` until the pre-serialized tree ends. Custom class instances still show as `<Type object at 0x…>` until a formatter is added.

To show dunder locals, the engine would need an additional flag (not exposed today). Do not duplicate filtering in the IDE unless the engine is changed to pass raw names through.

#### C / C++

No `filterInternals` equivalent. `stackTrace` reflects the DWARF backtrace for instrumented user code. Variable formatting follows DWARF type info (see `tools/dap/tests/formatting/`).

### Program End

When the program finishes, a `terminated` event is emitted:

```ts
if (msg.type === 'event' && msg.event === 'terminated') {
  // clean up debugger UI
}
```

---

## Notes

- The engine compiles C++ to WASM in-browser using clang — the first run may take a few seconds.
- There is one thread (`id: 1`). Multi-threading is not supported.
- `send()` returns the response synchronously. DAP traffic that is pushed from the adapter arrives asynchronously via `on('event', ...)`.
- Variable handles (`variablesReference` from `scopes` / `variables`) are invalidated when you **`continue`** or issue a **step** request; always re-query after the next `stopped`.
- Scripted DAP scenarios live under `tools/dap/tests/`. From the repository root, run **`npm run tools:dap`** to execute the suite (optionally `npm run tools:dap -- <test-name>` for a single case).
